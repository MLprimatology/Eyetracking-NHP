Hyperbolic discounting experiment, using Bayesian Adaptive Design 

We use Bayesian Adaptive Design to run a highly efficient experiment in order to get a very precise measure of the parameters of a hyperbolic discounting model.

The experiment:
Participants get an information screen. In each trial they will choose between two prospects. These consist of a reward, a delay, and a probability of occurring. Participants choose using the left or right keys.
