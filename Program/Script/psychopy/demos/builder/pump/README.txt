Syringe Pump Operation: "Bubble Cycle"
--------------------------------------

These routines will guide the user through the process of filling a set of
Cetoni neMESYS syringe pumps and the removal of air bubbles.

For instructions how to set up the syringe pump system, please refer to



The procedure works as follows:

  - The spray head is removed, and the inlet tubes are placed in the stimulus
    reservoirs.

  - The syringes are partially filled with liquid. They will also aspirate
    air, as the inlet tube and valves are filled with air at the beginning of
    the procedure.

  - If one were now to simply empty and re-fill the syringes, some of the air
    bubbles would always remain trapped at the very tip of the syringes.
    Therefore, we apply a small trick here: The inlet tubes are removed from
    the reservoirs, and the syringes aspirate air again. This causes small
    air bubbles to burst.

  - Then, the tubes are inserted into the reservoirs again, to aspirate more
    liquid and to remove the air from the tubes.

  - The syringes now contain liquid and a substantial amount of air, which is
    located at the tip of the syringes (which are placed vertically in the
    pumps).

  - Now, the syringes are partially emptied and refilled repeatedly to remove
    any air from the system and to fill the tubing with liquid.

  - When done, the spray head can reattached.
