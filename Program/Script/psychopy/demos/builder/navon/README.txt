Navon (1977) - global/local processing
==========================================

The experiment
------------------------
    
This is classic task testing the relative importance of global- versus
local-processing.

Large letters are presented that are made up of smaller letters
and the small and large letters may be the same (congruent) or different.
The question is whether the incongruence affects your reaction time to detect
the large letter, or the small letter.

In this version you need to respond as quickly as possible to report the
identity of the small letters.

Analysing your data
------------------------

After the experiment a data/ folder will have been created for you, and it
will contain an excel file with your data. Sort your data by congruence and
see how your mean reaction time compares for congruent and incongruent trials
    
Notes on implementation
------------------------

This study includes a feedback Routine and the trial has several stimuli
coming on and off at different times.
