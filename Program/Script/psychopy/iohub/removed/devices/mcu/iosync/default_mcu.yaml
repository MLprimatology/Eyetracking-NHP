# This file includes all valid mcu.iosync.ioSync Device
# settings that can be specified in an iohub_config.yaml

# created by the ioHub Process will be assigned the default value

#
mcu.iosync.MCU:
    
    # name: The unique name to assign to the device instance created.
    #   The device is accessed from within the PsychoPy script 
    #   using the name's value; therefore it must be a valid Python
    #   variable name as well.

    # model_name:The labjack.AnalogInput device model name is used to alter
    #   internal Device logic based on which version of the labjack
    #   device is going to be used. 
    #   Currently, only the U6 model is officially supported.
    #
    model_name: ioSync

    # monitor_event_types: Specify which of the device's supported event
    #   types you would like the ioHub to monitor for.
    #
    monitor_event_types: [AnalogInputEvent, DigitalInputEvent, ThresholdEvent]

    # serial_port: The serial port the MCU is using to interface with the 
    #    ioHub computer. On Windows, serial ports will be in the form
    #    'COMx', where x is the serial port number, usually ranging between 1 
    #    and 32. For example, COM6 would indicate the MCU to be used is 
    #    to serial port 6. 
    #    For Linux and OS X, serial ports are usually specified as ... TBC
    #    To autodetect an ioSync, set to 'auto'.

    # device_timer: Devices that require polling to read any new native events
    #   that have become available must specify a device_timer property, with an
    #   interval sub property that specifies how frequently the device would be polled
    #   by the ioHub Server. The time is specified in sec.msec format and is a 'requested'
    #   polling interval. The actual polling interval will vary from this somewhat, the 
    #   magnitude of which depends on the computer hardware and OS being used and the
    #   number of other polled devices being monitored. The 'configdence_interval'
    #   attribute of events that have a parent device that is polled often can be used to
    #   determine the actual polling rate being achieved by the ioHub Process.

    # enable: Specifies if the device should be enabled by ioHub and monitored
    #   for events.

    #   device's enableEventReporting method is made with a parameter value of True.
    #   True = Automatically start reporting events for this device when the experiment starts.
